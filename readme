The is sample application built with spring-boot to demonstrate Kafka.
Also we have used cassandra as DB. 

A. user-service
B. notificaiton-service
C. schema-registry
D. eureka-server. 
On user-service the user is registered in cassandra database(POST request to save user data) and the user-data is publish on 
kafka. The published data is then subscribed by the notification-service. Eventually notification-service saves the details 
in cassandra DB again marking that the welcome mail has been sent to the use as a notification. We have not used the mailing
service here. Here we have schema registry which serves the purpose of saving the schema of the user-data that we would be 
publishing. Eureka server serves the purpose of service registry.
